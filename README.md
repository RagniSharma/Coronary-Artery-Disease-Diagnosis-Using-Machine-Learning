# Coronary-Artery-Disease-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning

this is a project repository for the end term research project on Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning. 
the model refers 0-4 in the target variable to detect the symptoms of CAD, with 0 being the no disease detected, 1-3 being the symptoms are referring and 4 being the confirmation of the disease.

in this project 8 models are used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting and Binary Classification
